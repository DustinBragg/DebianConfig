# Debian Config
All that's needed to get my full Linux configuration up and running.

**Must be ran from a subfolder one-level deep in the home directory!**
**(ex. *~/DebianConfig/install_config.sh*)**

### install_config.sh
Fully installs and configures i3wm and related desktop environment stuff.

### install_apps.sh
Installs multiple day-to-day apps that I would eventually have to install sooner or later.

### install_steam_nvidia.sh
Steam requires some i386 libraries to work properly, this installs required prereqs for recent NVIDIA GPUs alongside Steam itself.
